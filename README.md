# Analysis_of_World_Population
In this project, I analyze the world's population data  from a dataset retrieved from Kaggle. The dataset has comprises of information on world population data from different countries over the period of 1970 to 2022. 



Some of the questions that will be answered from the dataset include:
a) What is the highest and lowest population sizes in the year 2022?
b) What countries have a total population that is greater than the average population in 2020?
c) What countries were the most densely populated in 2022?
